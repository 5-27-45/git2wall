# Git2Wall CLI

## Rationale

> *“It's not about the Destination, it's about the journey.”* - Ralph Waldo Emerson, Self-Reliance

How true is this quote for us developers?

Every time we work on a project, no matter how simple it is, we end up running into **new challenges**, **new problems** and spending hours to find the solutions. After days, weeks, months spent solving those problems, fixing bugs, or implementing new features, what's left?

The product itself, right. But the only result doesn't do us justice.

Git2Wall wants to help you remember the **huge** journey and the many stories behind every project in a tangible, concrete way. And what's better way to do so than printing this history on a canvas, and framing it?

Git2Wall is a tool to generate and print a canvas starting from a git repo history graph.

## Quick Start

You can install Git2Wall cli globally via

```
$ npm install -g git2wall
```

and run using

```
$ git2wall
```

Or run directly using npx

```
